Hello!

This is the read me for the RF Scavanger hunt application

Included is all the .py files for the program. Our program runs natively under the Linux architecture. To run under windows, please launch the main.py from a pycharm IDE or another python development environment. 
The program will create a users.txt file, and user folders with info.txt files. Please do not augment the txt files, as the program needs to be able to retrieve information from them.
The program will take some time to process a CSV file, Please be patient.
Libraries used include:
Numpy
Scipi
Os
Shutil
CustomTkinter
Matplotlib

Please make sure these packages are installed, and you are utilizing a python 3 interpreter. The CSV algorithm will crash to program if its modified and cannot return a proper value, so take caution when editing. 

We tested our program using the RF analyzer app by Dennis Mantz. Provided is a test IQ file to be converted. To use, please register, log in, and in the file browser, select the IQ file. It will be moved into your directory for faster access

When using the Phone application, please try to keep trace times between 5 â€“ 10 seconds. A sample rate of 1 Million samples per second is what the program is expecting
